# discordimageupload
Upload an image to a Discord server via a webhook with a simple HTML / JavaScript interface

## Instructions
Access upload.html with the parameter *key*, and use the address of the webhook key that Discord
provides to you in your server. The key is the text in the URL after `/webhooks/` and should
look something like this:

    468336051234567890/qSzasoEIcWkeOybpZA0DvvSL7kZZFNJCgcZCuBwMi5RSMM3p4KhAQEjbI25Mx6MauGDI
	
When you access the page, simply select an image with the *Choose file* button and then tap *Upload*.

## Live tool

Don't want the hassle of setting up the script on your own server? Then don't worry! Use this
live page to use the Discord uploader right away. Remember to add your key onto the end of the URL:
